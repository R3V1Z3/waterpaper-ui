# Waterpaper UI

A digital replica of an early user interface design, from back in the olde times when UI was done in watercolor. Being quite aged now, it may be a bit tough to read. But it helps to see just how difficult UI work was in the olde days.

Works fine with light and solarized themes. Reportedly, dark themes were the bane of ancient UI.

## Amazing Inkscape Filters
Waterpaper UI uses one of [Inkscape's](https://inkscape.org/) outstanding filters to yield a relatively realistic watercolor effect.

FEATURES

* Shows how unfeasible it is to code using watercolor.
* CPU-intensive styling accurately emulates sluggish interfaces of olden times.
