# Waterpaper UI

A digital replica of an early user interface design, from back in the olde times when UI was done in watercolor. Being quite aged now, it may be a bit tough to read. But it helps to see just how difficult UI work was in the olde days.

NOTE: Waterpaper UI doesn't really work well with dark syntax themes. It Works fine with light and solarized themes. Reportedly, dark themes were the bane of ancient UI.

## Amazing Inkscape Filters
Waterpaper UI uses one of [Inkscape's](https://inkscape.org/) outstanding filters to yield a relatively realistic watercolor effect.
